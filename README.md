As a member of the Big Space Explorer team, discover the location of hidden beacons throughout 40+ systems. Work alone or with friends to uncover secret co-ordinates, travel to alien worlds, and establish far-flung bases to operate from. See you in space!

Here's a handy systems map - the in-game co-ordinates of all the systems are found in-game on papers (search the ships).
